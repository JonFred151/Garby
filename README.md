# Garby
Garby Goes To trash land 
Platform/ puzzle solving 
Garby used a lot of asset from previous project that I worked on like my platform 
The game goes through three levels and each level has a set of enemies. I recommend changing powers for each room as each room has those unique enemies only in there. The boss is name Jared and the king of trashland, garby job is to clean up his act and take the trash out. 
Garby has three ability Fire, Sword, And hammer. With the fire ability garby shoots out a flame breath and scorches enemies. with the sword ability garby gets a bottle to try and stab enemies with, and finally garby gets a hammer to smash and crash the bones of his enemies. 
The controls are:
“A” moves left
“D” moves right 
“Space” jumps (total of 5 jumps can be perform) 
“Q” spits up the power that garby has 
“E” inhales enemies and uses garby special moves when he has ability
“F” fire a projectile when graby has an enemy in his mouth 
“S” swallows the enemy and give the ability of the enemy  

Secrete controls:
“P” give you hammer ability (only works on garby )
“O” give you fire ability (only works on garby )
”I” give you sword ability(only works on garby ) 
“L” give you full health (works on all of them)
